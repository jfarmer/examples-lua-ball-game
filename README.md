# A Simple Ball Game in Lua

This is a simple "ball game" / demo in Lua.  To get this running you should download and install [Love2D](https://love2d.org/), a 2D game engine for Lua.

If you want to run the game, create a zip file from this directory and open it with the Love application.  Alternatively, if you're comfortable with the command-line, you can point the command-line `love` tool at this directory.
